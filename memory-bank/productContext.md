# Product Context: WoW 3.3.5a ROG Ally Controller Enhancement

## 1. Problem Statement

World of Warcraft (version 3.3.5a) is designed primarily for keyboard and mouse input. While addons like ConsolePortLK attempt to bridge the gap for controller users, they often introduce clunkiness, complex configuration processes (requiring keyboard/mouse intervention), and don't fully optimize the UI/UX for seamless controller navigation on handheld devices like the ROG Ally. This results in a suboptimal gaming experience for players who prefer or require controller input on these devices.

## 2. Project Purpose & Justification

This project exists to create a truly controller-native experience for WoW 3.3.5a on the ROG Ally. The goals are:

*   **Enhanced Accessibility & Comfort:** Allow players to enjoy WoW 3.3.5a on a handheld device with the comfort and familiarity of a controller, without the frustrations of current solutions.
*   **Improved User Experience (UX):** Design an intuitive UI and control scheme that feels natural and efficient, minimizing the need to switch back to keyboard/mouse for any game function, including configuration.
*   **Simplified Setup:** Provide an all-in-one solution that integrates controller support and UI enhancements directly into the client, installable via a simple package, removing the need for users to manage multiple addons, external mapping tools, and complex configurations.
*   **Increased Enjoyment:** By addressing the core usability issues, the project aims to make playing WoW 3.3.5a on the ROG Ally a more enjoyable and immersive experience.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Goals

*   **Seamless Navigation:** All game menus, windows, and interactions should be fully navigable using only the controller.
*   **Intuitive Controls:** The control scheme, particularly for combat (XHB system) and menu navigation, should be easy to learn and efficient to use.
*   **Clear Visuals:** UI elements should be appropriately sized, with clear fonts and iconography suitable for the ROG Ally's screen.
*   **Effortless Configuration:** Binding spells, abilities, items, and macros to controller buttons should be a simple, visual, and entirely controller-driven process within the game.
*   **"Feels Like Native" Support:** The end product should make the game feel as though it was originally designed with controller support in mind.
*   **Stability and Performance:** The solution should be stable and not introduce performance degradation.

## 4. Target User

*   ROG Ally owners who wish to play WoW 3.3.5a (on an AzerothCore server) using the built-in controller.
*   Players who find existing controller solutions for WoW cumbersome or incomplete.
*   Players looking for a more relaxed, couch-friendly WoW experience on a handheld device.
