# Progress: WoW 3.3.5a ROG Ally Controller Enhancement

## 1. Current Status: Phase 0 - Initialization & Planning

As of the last update, the project is in its initial planning and setup phase. The core concept and high-level design have been established.

## 2. What Works (Conceptual)

*   **Project Vision:** Clear understanding of the goal to create a seamless controller experience for WoW 3.3.5a on ROG Ally.
*   **Technical Approach Defined:** Hybrid DLL (C++ for XInput) + Lua Addon (UI & Game Logic).
*   **Core UI/UX Principles Established:** Inspired by FFXIV (XHB), ESO (clarity), focusing on controller-native navigation and custom binding UI.
*   **Memory Bank Initialized:** Core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been created and populated with initial information.

## 3. What's Left to Build (High-Level Overview)

*   **Phase 1: Core Functionality - Proof of Concept & Foundational Elements**
    *   **Input DLL (C++):**
        *   Basic XInput reading (all buttons, triggers, sticks).
        *   DLL injection mechanism into `WoW.exe`.
        *   Initial DLL-to-Lua communication API (e.g., functions callable from Lua to get controller state).
    *   **Lua Addon (Core Systems):**
        *   Basic framework for the addon.
        *   Communication layer to call DLL functions and receive data.
        *   Simple test UI to display raw controller input received from the DLL.
        *   Rudimentary XHB display logic (visuals only, no binding yet).
        *   Initial redesign of one core game window (e.g., Character or Inventory) for controller navigation.
*   **Phase 2: UI Implementation & Binding Logic**
    *   **Lua Addon (Full UI Overhaul):**
        *   Complete implementation of all redesigned game windows as per UI mockups (Character, Inventory, Spellbook, Talents, Quest Log, Map, Vendor, Loot, Social, etc.).
        *   Full XHB system implementation (multiple sets, visual feedback).
        *   Development of the "Controller Setup" UI: visual binding interface, action lists (spells, items, macros), profile saving/loading.
    *   **Lua Addon (Binding & Action Execution):**
        *   Logic to translate controller inputs (via DLL data) + user bindings into WoW API calls (`CastSpellByName`, `UseAction`, etc.).
        *   Targeting system enhancements.
        *   Contextual interaction system.
*   **Phase 3: Refinement, Testing & Packaging**
    *   **Input DLL & Lua Addon:**
        *   Advanced features (e.g., trigger sensitivity, vibration feedback if deemed useful).
        *   On-screen keyboard implementation via DLL/Lua.
        *   Performance optimization and bug fixing.
        *   Stability testing, especially controller hot-plugging.
        *   Comprehensive testing on ROG Ally hardware.
    *   **Installer Package:**
        *   Creation of an installer (e.g., Inno Setup) to bundle the client, DLL, addon, and default configurations.

## 4. Known Issues / Current Blockers

*   None at this conceptual stage. Technical challenges are anticipated (see `techContext.md`) but are not yet blockers.

## 5. Milestones (Tentative)

*   **M0: Project Initialization & Planning Complete (Current Stage - Almost Done)**
    *   Memory Bank fully initialized.
*   **M1: Proof of Concept (PoC) Successful**
    *   DLL reads XInput.
    *   Lua addon reads data from DLL and displays it in WoW.
*   **M2: Core UI & XHB Functional**
    *   XHB displays and can have actions (manually configured in Lua for now).
    *   At least two major game windows are fully controller navigable.
*   **M3: Binding UI Operational**
    *   "Controller Setup" screen allows users to bind actions to XHB/buttons via controller.
*   **M4: Full Feature Parity & Initial Testing**
    *   All planned UI windows redesigned and functional.
    *   Targeting and interaction systems complete.
    *   Initial round of testing on ROG Ally.
*   **M5: Polishing, Bug Fixing & Installer Ready**
    *   Performance optimizations, bug fixes.
    *   Installer package created and tested.
*   **M6: Release Candidate / Project Completion**
